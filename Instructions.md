# Writing The Classes Of A Game

### Objetive

Create a generic class that represents an adventure hero, with the following properties:
- Name;
- Age;
- Type (example: warrior, mage, monk, ninja).

In addition, the class should contain a method called "attack" that meets the following requirements:
- Display the message: "The **{type}** attacked using **{attack}**";
- The **{type}** should be concatenated with the type that is in the class property;
- The **{attack}** should have a different description according to the type, consistent with the table below:
	- If *mage* -> display in the attack **{used magic}**;
	- If *warrior* -> display in the attack **{used sword}**;
	- If *monk* -> display in the attack **{used martial arts}**;
	- If *ninja* -> display in the attack **{used shuriken}**.

###  What should be used:
- Variables;
- Operators;
- Loop structures;
- Decision structures;
- Functions;
- Classes and objects.

### Output
In the end, the message should be displayed:
"The **{type}** attacked using **{attack}**".
Example: "The **Mage** attacked using **Magic**"; "The **Warrior** attacked using **Sword**".
